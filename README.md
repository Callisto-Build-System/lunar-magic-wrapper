# Lunar Magic Wrapper

A lightweight wrapper around the command line functionality of [Lunar Magic](http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lm/index.html), a commonly used Super Mario World editor.

For details on usage check the [documentation](https://docs.rs/lunar-magic-wrapper/latest/lunar_magic_wrapper/).

Note that this is Windows only for now and relies on invoking `cmd` since Lunar Magic isn't particularly well-behaved on the command line.
